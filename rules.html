    <h1>Rules</h1>
    <ol>
      <li>
        You can only move one piece of your own color to a different space on the board,
        within one space of itself.
      </li>
      <li>
        The black circles are unoccupied spaces, which you can move a piece to on your turn.
      </li>
      <li>
        The goal of the game is to get your pieces into a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line,
        and the starting position of the pieces do not count as a win.
