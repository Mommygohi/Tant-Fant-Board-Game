    <h1>Rules</h1>
    <ol>
      <li>
        You can only move one piece of your own color per turn.
      </li>
      <li>
        You can move a piece to a different space if it is unoccupied,
        and if it follows the pattern on the board.
      </li>
      <li>
        The black circles are unoccupied spaces, which you can move a piece to on your turn.
      </li>
      <li>
        The color on the left side starts first, and then the right side, alternating turns until
        someone wins the game.
      </li>
      <li>
        The goal of the game is to get your pieces into a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line,
        and the starting position of the pieces do not count as a win.
      </li>
    </ol>
